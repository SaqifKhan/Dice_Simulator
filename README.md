# Dice_Simulator
This dice simulator, when ran will generate a number between 1 - 6. It then asks the user if they would like to roll again. If they do so, the simulator will generate a second dice roll. Both rolls will be printed out in the terminal. This assignment demonstrates the use of basic principles if python.
